The Travel Explorer web application is a lightweight and interactive trip-planning tool designed to help travelers quickly discover attractions, filter places by interest, and build a personalized half-day itinerary. Users can search for a city or landmark, apply filters such as food, culture, nature, or nightlife, and instantly view curated results with descriptions and time estimates. With a simple drag-and-drop interface, activities can be added to an itinerary, reordered, or removed, while the app automatically calculates the total trip duration and warns if it exceeds a half-day limit. The app also supports saving, loading, and exporting itineraries as JSON files, making it easy to share or revisit plans later. Though the current version uses a sample dataset (Barcelona), it provides a clear foundation for scaling with real APIs, maps, and multiple destinations â€” offering travelers a practical yet visually engaging trip-planning experience.
